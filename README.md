#### Oh Gates!:
A function generator that works like follows:
takes gate input
and outputs 1 gate for each X number of gates it receives

if the buffer is set to 2, then it will output 1 gate on the 2nd gate, skipping just one, increase the buffer size for different numbers

The 2nd knob controls the gate length and defined between
40ms-6s
